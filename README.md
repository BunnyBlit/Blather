# Blather
A Personal Blog! You probably don't want to be here-- but if you do, content is in Markdown, the templates are just some light config work over the basic stuff. I'm doing CSS raw like a monster, deployment is rsync.

I'm storing images in git under content like a madman because I don't have a great image hosting solution at the moment. I hope to get them out of git sometime!
It's all very boring.
