Summary: What I've done, and what I can do for you!

Do you need a Computer Person For A Thing? I can be that person! 

The blog is focused on the weird and wonderful, but that's just stuff on my time. On your time, I can make your thing go.

My current day job is a Principal Data Scientist at Zynga, on the Applied AI team. I've worked on several procedural content generation systems for mobile games across the stack-- on the backend (SQL, AWS, Docker, Python) and the web frontend (React, TypeScript). I've also worked on publishing and advertising tools (Adobe After Effects). At Z, most of my ML experience has been with reinforcement learning, but the suits want Big Generative Models and so I'm starting to do that now.

I got my Masters in Computer Science at UCSC and my undergrad degree at the University of New Orleans. While getting my degrees, I bounced around: supervised learning for recipes and food, hardware simulation for drones in the Unreal engine, embedded programming for high performance cameras, and was a Teaching Assistant for a few quarters too.

We both know, recruiter reading this, that "make computer do" is only the tip of the iceberg. No person is an island, and no software gets built alone. I work best on a team-- in leading (breaking a system down into actionable parts, technical specification writing, unblocking my team, negotiating production cycles such that no one needs to crunch, rapid prototyping, etc) and following (contextualizing my own work as part of a whole, helping other line engineers, focused PR reviews, writing tests, etc).

In non-day job news, well, that's the rest of this blog! I'm very interested in tools engineering for games. I'd love to work on authoring interfaces, design tools, and really any technical work that gets close to the meat and bone of a game.
