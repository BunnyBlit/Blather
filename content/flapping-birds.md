Summary: If we can model a [bouncing ball]({filename}/bouncing-balls.md), what about a flapping bird?   
Status: draft   

[Previously]({filename}/bouncing-balls.md), I wrote a lot about [Hybrid Dynamic Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3337722.3337757) and simulating a simple bouncing ball.

I wrote a bunch of something adjacent to Python code about it. What about a real video game? Can we use this framework to simulate a video game? Before we really dig in, the first post borrowed mostly theory from "Analyzing Action Games: A Hybrid Systems Approach" paper by Yegeta Zeleke et al. This post is heavily based on the paper: I'm mostly writing their theoretical model in Python, and leaned heavily on the [Matlab reference implementation](https://github.com/HybridSystemsLab/FlappyBirdReachability) to help me. I'll note when I'm cribbing, in particular, from the Matlab code.

The Python is all mine, but the actual algorithms to solve the problem and the ideas are all theirs.

### The Model of Flappy Bird
Ok, to recap, I need four functions:  

* ```flow(...)``` tells me how the game changes over time, by taking in the current time and the state, and giving me the derivative of the state with respect to time  

* ```jump(...)``` tells me how the game changes instantly, snapping from one state to another. It takes in a time and a state and returns a different state.  

* ```flow_check(...)``` tells me if the game should be flowing or not. It takes in a time and a state and returns an integer (0 for not flowing, 1 for flowing). It's gotta be an `int` to work with other libraries to use this model.  

* ```jump_check(...)``` tells me if the game should jump or not. It takes in a time and a state and returns an integer (0 for do not jump, 1 for jump). It's gotta be an `int` for the same reasons ```flow_check``` does.

All these functions deal with state... so what state does flappy bird need? Well, we'll need both vertical and horizontal position because those will change. We'll need vertical velocity because the rate that the bird rises (or falls) changes based on time and input.

Oh! And something to track if the player is pushing the flap button or not. And, I know that eventually this all needs to be an `array-like`.


```python
from collections import namedtuple

# as before, a named tuple doesn't really solve our problems
# but it does make the constructor a little nicer
# its easy enough to make a class that implements the right protocols, but compactness, yeah?
State = namedtuple('State', ['x_pos', 'y_pos', 'y_vel', 'pressed'])
state = State(x_pos=0.0, y_pos=2.0, y_vel=0.0, pressed=1)
print(state)
```

    State(x_pos=0.0, y_pos=2.0, y_vel=0.0, pressed=1)


Ok, so let's march through, starting with `flow`. Flappy the bird always moves right at a constant speed, so the derivative of their `x` position is a constant velocity. When they're falling, Flappy the bird accelerates-- so when `pressed == 0`, `y` position should change according to whatever `y` velocity is, and `y` velocity should change at a magic `-9.81`. `pressed` should never change during flows, it's derivative is `0`. So flow looks a little like...


```python
from typing import Tuple
# delta here is just shorthand for "change in", what this is tracking is how the corresponding state elements
# change over time 
StateDerivative = namedtuple('StateDerivative', ['delta_x_pos', 'delta_y_pos', 'delta_y_vel', 'delta_pressed'])
def flow(time:float, state:State) -> Tuple[float, float, float, int]:
    return StateDerivative(
        delta_x_pos=2.0, # this is a bit of an extra magic number. It could be anything positive.
        delta_y_pos=state[2], # this is y_vel in our state vector
        delta_y_vel=-9.81,
        delta_pressed=0
    )
# time, just like before, is arbitrary until we hook up the ODE solver
state_derivative = flow(0.0, State(
    x_pos=0.0,
    y_pos=2.0,
    y_vel=0.0,
    pressed=1
))
print(state_derivative)
```

    StateDerivative(delta_x_pos=2.0, delta_y_pos=0.0, delta_y_vel=-9.81, delta_pressed=0)


But... that's only half the problem, right? What about when flappy is flapping? At least from a pure mathematics / physics perspective flappy flaps kinda... oddly.

Flappy doesn't accelerate when they flap. They move upward at a constant velocity.

I'm sure you, handsome reader, know this already but: this is _really_ common in action games like platformers! It makes characters easier to control and more predictable-- if your button presses applied acceleration, rather than pure velocity, you'd need to counteract your current trajectory before going somewhere new. It'd make poor flappy a lot less agile.

So, lets add all that in:


```python
def flow(time:float, state:State) -> Tuple[float, float, float, int]:
    if state[3] == 0: # <-- âœ¨ New! âœ¨ not pressed
        return StateDerivative(
            delta_x_pos=2.0,
            delta_y_pos=state[2],
            delta_y_vel=-9.81,
            delta_pressed=0
        )
    # also âœ¨ New! âœ¨, this handles our pressed case
    elif state[3] == 1: #pressed
        return StateDerivative(
            delta_x_pos=2.0, 
            delta_y_pos=2.0, # just like the change in x position, this is also pretty magic
            delta_y_vel=0, # y velocity doesn't change, it's constant while flapping!
            delta_pressed=0 
        )
    else:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Invalid state! {state}, pressed != 0 or 1")
    
unpressed_state_derivative = flow(0.0, State(
    x_pos=0.0,
    y_pos=2.0,
    y_vel=0.0,
    pressed=0
))
print("How we flow when the flap button is not pressed:")
print(unpressed_state_derivative)

pressed_state_derivative = flow(0.0, State(
    x_pos=0.0,
    y_pos=2.0,
    y_vel=0.0,
    pressed=1 #<-- âœ¨ note the difference! âœ¨
))
print("How we flow when the flap button is pressed:")
print(pressed_state_derivative)
```

    How we flow when the flap button is not pressed:
    StateDerivative(delta_x_pos=2.0, delta_y_pos=0.0, delta_y_vel=-9.81, delta_pressed=0)
    How we flow when the flap button is pressed:
    StateDerivative(delta_x_pos=2.0, delta_y_pos=2.0, delta_y_vel=0, delta_pressed=0)


That seems about right to me! And since we're here, let's do `flow_check`... and, for right now, it's also going to be very, very simple just to get us off the ground.


```python
def flow_check(time:float, state:State) -> int:
    # yeah, we're always flowing again. ğŸ™ƒ
    return 0
```

Ok, `jump` time. Well, flappy only jumps when we provide input. We need to both record that in the state, so we'll flow correctly and also set flappy's `y` velocity to what it should be when the button is pressed. Ya know, _do_ the jump.

`jump_check` is... just gonna never jump for now. We can check to make sure flappy falls correctly before adding more complex logic.


```python
def jump(time:float, state:State) -> Tuple[float, float, float, int]:
    new_pressed = abs(state[3] - 1) # a bit of a trick to flip 1 to 0 and 0 to 1. Not efficient. That'll come up later 
    if new_pressed == 1: #if we're going from not pressed to pressed...
        return State(
            x_pos=state[0],
            y_pos=state[1],
            y_vel=2.0, # using the same magic number as before! 
            pressed=new_pressed
        )
    else:
        return State(
            x_pos=state[0],
            y_pos=state[1],
            y_vel=state[2],
            pressed=new_pressed # almost an exact copy, except we change the pressed flag
        )
    
def jump_check(time:float, state:State) -> int:
    return 1 # never jump for now

old_state = State(
    x_pos=0.0,
    y_pos=2.0,
    y_vel=0.0,
    pressed=0
)
new_pressed_state = jump(0.0, old_state)
print("For pressing the button:")
print(f"Jumping from {old_state}")
print(f"to {new_pressed_state}")
print("----------")

old_state = State(
    x_pos=0.0,
    y_pos=2.0,
    y_vel=0.0,
    pressed=1
)
new_released_state = jump(0.0, old_state)
print("For releasing the button:")
print(f"Jumping from {old_state}")
print(f"to {new_released_state}")
```

    For pressing the button:
    Jumping from State(x_pos=0.0, y_pos=2.0, y_vel=0.0, pressed=0)
    to State(x_pos=0.0, y_pos=2.0, y_vel=2.0, pressed=1)
    ----------
    For releasing the button:
    Jumping from State(x_pos=0.0, y_pos=2.0, y_vel=0.0, pressed=1)
    to State(x_pos=0.0, y_pos=2.0, y_vel=0.0, pressed=0)


Alright. I'm gonna steal the `Hybrid System` and `System Parameters` structs from [the last article]({filename}/bouncing-balls.md). And while I'm there, lets snag the `solve_system` function too. And the graphing code, so we can see what this system does.

aaaannnnnnd

![An animated graph of a very sad run of flappy bird]({static}/images/flapping_birds_falling_birds.svg)

Ok, well, that's not the most compelling graph I've seen in my entire life. Once again, we're going under 0, when that's our unofficial death floor. There's also no obstacles. Or even flapping.

Let's start with the last thing because it's in the damn name: let's make this flappy bird flap.

### Making Flappy Bird Flap

So, a "flap" in our simple version of Bird De Flap is when the "flap" button is held down-- the `pressed` element of our state vector. We use the `jump` function to move to the "flapping" state from the "falling" state (and from "falling" --> "flapping" as well). We know we _should_ be jumping when `jump_check` says so.

So, when do we want `jump_check` to be 1? Well, lets just say it should be one between certain times to start:


```python
def jump_check(time:float, state:State) -> int:
    # âœ¨ New! âœ¨
    # we know our sim runs from time 0 to time 1, for right now. lets hardcode two jumps, one to set the "pressed"
    # element in our state vector, and one to unset it
    # bound the time so we only fire this once
    if time >= 0.5 and \
        time < 0.6 and \
            state[3] != 1: # the instant the button starts being pressed. Bound on both sides to only fire this once
        return 0
    elif time >= 0.6 and \
        state[3] != 0: # the instant the button stops being pressed.
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 # otherwise we're not jumping
    
jump_check.terminal = True # this function needs to stop our simulation, so its terminal now
```

![An animated graph of a simulation where flappy makes a single jump]({static}/images/flapping_birds_single_flap.svg)

Alright, that's starting to look a little better. Obviously, hardcoding jump points isn't where we want to be in life, but hey! Flappy has a trajectory that looks kinda sane!

Now we need collision detection, so the simulation stops when Flappy hits the bottom or top of the screen.

### Making Flappy Bird Die
So, uh, how are we going to do this? We could have a new state, `dead` and jump to it when flappy collides with the floor or roof. But, that'll lead to a lot of wasted work: the sim will still spin forward until it gets to `end_time` with noting meaningful to do. We want to stop the sim early.

We know that `jump_check` stops the sim early (with ```jump_check.terminal = True```), so collision is like a jump where we just stop simulating rather than jump. Let's add a collision detection function and modify both `jump_check` and `solve_system`


```python
 # âœ¨ New! âœ¨ Check to see if we're colliding with anything and need to die
def check_collision(state:State) -> bool:
    # the "height" of the level is gonna be a little arbitrary and hardcoded for now
    if state[1] <= 0.0 or state[1] >= 5.0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# lets change jump_check to identify collisions  
def jump_check(time:float, state:State) -> int:
    # âœ¨ New! âœ¨
    if check_collision(state):
        return 0
 
    if time >= 0.5 and \
        time < 0.6 and \
            state[3] != 1:
        return 0
    elif time >= 0.6 and \
        state[3] != 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1
jump_check.terminal = True # we've got a new function, so we need to set this again

# and now we also need to change solve_system to distinguish between solution stops-- did we
# stop flowing because we hit something or because we started jumping?
def solve_system(system:HybridSystem, params:SystemParameters, start_state:State) -> List[Any]:
    solution:List[Any] = [] # gradual typing is neat!
    cur_time = params.start_time
    number_of_jumps = 0
    state = start_state

    while (cur_time < params.end_time and number_of_jumps < params.max_jumps):
        if(system.flow_check(cur_time, state) == 0):
            ode_sol = integrate.solve_ivp(
                system.flow,
                (cur_time, params.end_time),
                state,
                events=[system.jump_check],
                max_step=0.01,
                atol=1e-6,
                rtol=1e-6
            )
            if ode_sol.status == -1:
                print(f"Solver failed with message: {ode_sol.message}")
                return solution
            for time, state in zip(ode_sol.t, ode_sol.y.T):
                solution.append((time, state))

            cur_time, state = solution[-1]
        
        # âœ¨ New! âœ¨
        if check_collision(state):
            return solution
        
        if (system.jump_check(cur_time, state) == 0):
            state = jump(cur_time, state)
            number_of_jumps += 1
    
    return solution
```

### Stuff To Dodge

Having an upper and lower bound is all well and good, but really Flappy Bird is hard because there is something to, ya know, dodge. Flap _around_. We need to add some obstacles. Classically, this is pipes-- but we don't really need things like "sprites", "graphics" or "art" in simulation land. We just care that there are some rectangular death zones spaced somewhat regularly apart.

I could start by hardcoding the pipe locations just like the level boundaries locations, but uuuuh. Look, I didn't love hardcoding in the boundaries in the last part and I want to eventually graph where the death zones are. It's time for a data structure.


```python
from pprint import pprint
@dataclass
class BoundingBox():
    """ Its a rectangle! Represented by the top left point, a width and a height
    """
    top_left: Tuple[float, float]
    width: float
    height: float

@dataclass
class FlappyLevel():
    """ It's a flappy bird level! We get a ceiling (going to high means death),
        a floor (going to low means death), and a list of obstacles (touching means death)
    """
    floor:float
    ceiling:float
    obstacles: List[BoundingBox]

sample_level = FlappyLevel(
    floor=0.0,
    ceiling=5.0,
    obstacles=[
        BoundingBox(
            top_left=(1.0, 5.0),
            width=0.5,
            height=3.5
        ),
        BoundingBox(
            top_left=(1.5, 0.75),
            width=0.5,
            height=0.75
        )
    ]
)
pprint(sample_level)
```

    FlappyLevel(floor=0.0,
                ceiling=5.0,
                obstacles=[BoundingBox(top_left=(1.0, 5.0), width=0.5, height=3.5),
                           BoundingBox(top_left=(1.5, 0.75),
                                       width=0.5,
                                       height=0.75)])


Ok, not the prettiest printing of all time there, but it'll do. Now, we need to update our `jump_check` function to actually use it. So, let's just add an argument-- oh.

well, uh.

hm.

Remember that `jump_check` must be in a very particular form because it's going to get called by `scipy` owned code as a part of `solve_ivp`. We can't just add an argument, the solver doesn't know anything about the level. There are a few ways to go forward here:
1. we control how `jump_check` executes and what it's scope is. We can save the level as a variable that's in scope while `jump_check` is doing its thing
2. that, but more formal: classes and objects

Which means, ugh, variable lifetime and all the other annoying things you need to start thinking about when you move from beyond easy "function only operates on its arguments" land. The Haskell people were right, side effects suck. Eventually, we're going to want to run many simulations on one level [^2], so wrapping up everything as a "simulation" class makes sense to me. The stuff that stays the same from run to run becomes class attributes, and we can pass the stuff that differs into the `solve_system` instance method.

Because [bound methods of instances](https://docs.python.org/3.11/reference/datamodel.html#instance-methods) work like a regular old callable from the outside, we can have the object "ride along" with invocation, with our solver being non-the-wiser [^3]

Does that make sense? I hope so. 3,2,1, let's jam.

[^2]: spoilers
[^3]: this behavior is not free-- I do pay a penalty for passing in the instance as the first argument, but lord, do I have bigger problems elsewhere.

Ugh, as a graph, please?

Ok, well, it's not _the best level of all time_ but it is! Let's maybe make a better level. And just as a fun little treat, what if we didn't have to write a Flappy bird level by hand each time-- we don't really have a good way to do that, after all. Writing out all that level data by hand in Python isn't, ya know, a super funky fresh time. What if we had a little procedural level generation, as a treat?

### A Little Procedural Level Generation, as a Treat

Each level of Flappy Bird isn't, exactly, "every frame a painting". And that's kind of the point-- any one level of bird de flap isn't really supposed to be memorable. It provides a bunch of levels that all have the same sorts of qualities, we don't really talk about "that really rough set of pipes three minutes in". Flappy's levels aren't designed to invoke a particular feeling, it works on a _space_ of levels that all kind of invoke that feeling. 

The aesthetics and dynamics of procedural content generation, and how they intersect with level design and game design, are complicated-- and I really don't have the space in this blog post to get into it. For me, right now, the important things are:
1. Writing a generative algorithm won't ruin the Flappy Bird-ness of my little simulation, because the actual game generated content dynamically
2. Writing a generative algorithm means I don't need to worry about authoring a level, which means I don't need to write tooling to do that _nor_ do I need hand write some python objects
3. The reference matlab implementation has one, so I just need to copy theirs [^4]

[^4]: ok, before I lose it-- a look behind the curtain: I originally wrote this whole simulation system in Python before I abandoned it due to some problems I'll get to. Then, a few months later, I started rewriting everything up as some blog posts. As part of my original work, I wrote a procedural level generation system. I have the Python code here. I _swore_ I cribbed it from the original paper's [Matlab reference implementation](https://github.com/HybridSystemsLab/FlappyBirdReachability). But, now that I'm actually writing this up for real, I can't find it. The Matlab code has five fixed choices for a simulation level, but no procedure for generating one on the fly. I'm still not convinced that I came up with this, not that it's particularly clever but I'm particularly dumb. I'm sticking to my story.

Here's a weird thing about Flappy Bird levels: the pipes are always aligned with each other. The example above, with my mismatched death boxes, never happens. It also kinda looks like the pipes are _regularly_ spaced apart, too. Ugh, this is weird to talk about without a reference, I'm gonna mark up a [screenshot from a Java clone of the original Flappy Bird](https://github.com/williamfiset/FlappyBird) with some distance relationships in a snippet of a level:

![A marked up screenshot of Flappy Bird, pointing out how the horiztonal distance between pipes is always the same, and the vertical gap between pipes is also always the same]({static}/images/flappy_markup_markup.png)

The horizontal distance between pipes is always the same, and the vertical gap between pipes is also always the same. There's a minimum height for a pipe to be, and a corresponding maximum height. Flappy Bird levels aren't very random at all, when you look at it. So, uh, what might an algorithm for generating a level look like?

Well, I can place a pair of pipes, a top pipe and bottom pipe, at some regular interval. Say, uh, 2. So, the first pair of pipes would go at, say, x position 1. Then the next pair of pipes would go in at `1 + pipe_width + 2`. The third pipe would go at `(1 + pipe_width + 2) + pipe_width + 2`, and so on. It's recursive! Gotta love to see it.

For heights, we know there's always a fixed gap of... lets say, 1. We know there's a minimum pipe height, let's also make that 1. We can than randomly pick a bottom pipe hight from 1 - 3, and we can figure out our top pipe hight by all the constraints we've placed (keeping with our convention that the ceiling is at 5, and the floor is at 0). if the bottom pipe is 1 tall, then there's a gap of 1, which means the top pipe must be 3 tall. And because the top pipe must always have at least a hight of 1 and that there must always be a gap of at least 1, the bottom pipe can't be any taller than 3.

It's a little funny how deeply constrained this whole thing is, it's surprisingly (to me, at least) not that random! Let's write some Python:


```python
import random
from typing import Optional

def generate_flappy_level(seed: Optional[int]) -> FlappyLevel:
    # hold up partner, what's that seed argument?
    # it's a magic number to kick off random choices-- rnd(seed) will always give the same sequence of numbers.
    # this is mostly useful for developers to get repeatable behavior from code that needs randomness for debugging
    # or evaluation. It's also used by Slay the Spire players to find unwinnable games.
    if seed: random.seed(seed)

    # this is a bunch of stuff that should be parameters (really, wrapped up in a struct as like FlappyLevelGenParams or some such)
    # but works well enough for explaining the procedure
    lower_bound: float = 0.0
    upper_bound: float = 5.0
    x_start: float = 1.0
    x_period: float = 2.0
    heights: List[float] = [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3] # breaking down our "random height from 1-3" into five distinct choices. It'll add a little chop to the level, which I think is good, actually
    
    pipe_width: float = 0.7
    gap: float = 1.0
    num_gaps: int = 6 # this is the size of our level, in terms of "number of gaps between pipes to clear".
                      # As we'll see later, this is more than long enough before we hit other problems.

    pipes = []
    for i in range(num_gaps):
        left_side = x_start + x_period * i
        bottom_pipe_height = random.choice(heights)
        top_pipe_height = upper_bound - (bottom_pipe_height + gap)
        pipes.append(BoundingBox((left_side, bottom_pipe_height), pipe_width, bottom_pipe_height))
        pipes.append(BoundingBox((left_side, upper_bound), pipe_width, top_pipe_height))

    return FlappyLevel(lower_bound, upper_bound, pipes)

hybrid_system_params = SystemParameters(0.0, 5.0, 5)
start_state = State(x_pos=0.0, y_pos=2.0, y_vel=0.0, pressed=0.0)
generated_level = generate_flappy_level(99)
sim = FlappyHybridSim(generated_level)
solution = sim.solve_system(hybrid_system_params, start_state)
```

Yeah, just like that! We can even watch our poor sim immediately eat shit now that the "pipes" are in a more correct place.

Huh.

Maybe we should like, figure out how to control Flappy the Bird better than just hardcoding the poor avian.
