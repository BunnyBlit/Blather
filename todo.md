## Just gonna list stuff I gotta work on in a public file
big airing my dirty laundry energy

Anyway
- [X] Back to the CSS mines to change how posts render in the root page view. Maybe also paginate them? I want to offset each post a little more, and mark which category its in.
- - a border, maybe?
- - don't mark the categories when _on_ the category page, as I'm in a one-category-per-article world (tags are for more free form stuff)
- [X] While I'm here, the title could be a little closer on mobile, and I want to add a tiny bit more padding between content and the edges on mobile

- [ ] Update the img CSS -- it should be really similar to the pre setup (no background)
- [ ] Add images and one more edit pass to "Healing is a Verb"
- - looking for more of the voice from my other writing.
- [ ] Change Action At A Distance
- - [ ] that title sucks
- - [ ] don't be weird about math notation
- - [ ] actually go into using the model with a solver, but don't go into solving details
- - [ ] get a solution from the bouncing ball model as an image
- [ ] A "Hire My Ass" page
- [ ] A "This Website Is Powered By" page listing the many, many tools I use
