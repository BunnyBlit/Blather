## Just gonna list stuff I gotta work on in a public file
big airing my dirty laundry energy

Anyway:
- [ ] Update the img CSS -- it should be really similar to the pre setup (no background)
- [ ] Add images and one more edit pass to "Healing is a Verb"
- - looking for more of the voice from my other writing.
- [ ] Change Action At A Distance
- - [ ] that title sucks
- - [ ] don't be weird about math notation
- - [ ] actually go into using the model with a solver, but don't go into solving details
- - [ ] get a solution from the bouncing ball model as an image
- [X] A "Hire My Ass" page
- - Need to add a kinda-sorta-official looking resume
- - contact info?
- [ ] A "This Website Is Powered By" page listing the many, many tools I use
