## Just gonna list stuff I gotta work on in a public file
big airing my dirty laundry energy

Anyway:
- [ ] Update the img CSS -- it should be really similar to the pre setup (no background)
- [ ] Change Action At A Distance
- - [ ] that title sucks
- - [ ] don't be weird about math notation
- - [ ] actually go into using the model with a solver, but don't go into solving details
- - [ ] get a solution from the bouncing ball model as an image
- [ ] A "This Website Is Powered By" page listing the many, many tools I use
- [ ] Drafts, get that figured out
